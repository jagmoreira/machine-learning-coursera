# Coursera' Machine Learning programming assigments

These are my solutions to the programming assignments of the [Machine Learning Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course taught by Andrew NG.

These assignments were completed using GNU Octave, version 4.2.1.

**Please do not look at the solutions if you are taking the course. It violates Coursera's Honor Code and diminishes your enjoyment of the course.**
